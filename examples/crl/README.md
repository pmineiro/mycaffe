NSW Data Files (Lalonde Sample)
-------------------------------

From [the nber](http://users.nber.org/~rdehejia/data/nswdata2.html):

> These files contain the treated and control units from the male sub-sample from the  National Supported Work Demonstration as used by Lalonde in his paper.
>
>  nsw_treated.txt (297 observations)
>
>  nsw_control.text (425 observations)
>
>  These are text files. The order of the variables from left to right is: treatment indicator (1 if treated, 0 if not treated), age, education, Black (1 if black, 0 otherwise), Hispanic (1 if Hispanic, 0 otherwise), married (1 if married, 0 otherwise), nodegree (1 if no degree, 0 otherwise), RE75 (earnings in 1975), and RE78 (earnings in 1978). The last variable is the outcome; other variables are pre-treatment.

PSID Data File
-----------------------

From [the nber](http://users.nber.org/~rdehejia/data/nswdata2.html):

>These six files contain the non-experimental comparison groups constructed by Lalonde from the Population Survey of Income Dynamics and the Current Population Survey, and the further subsets he created from the two basic comparison groups. CPS2 and CPS3 are very similar to, but not exactly the same as, as Lalonde's subsets; for CPS, we were unable to re-create his subsets exactly. The variables from left to right are: treatment indicator (1 if treated, 0 if not treated), age, education, Black (1 if black, 0 otherwise), Hispanic (1 if Hispanic, 0 otherwise), married (1 if married, 0 otherwise), nodegree (1 if no degree, 0 otherwise), RE74 (earnings in 1974), RE75 (earnings in 1975), and RE78 (earnings in 1978).
